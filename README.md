Rookie Video Game Dev from Romania. Working only in Godot for now. I don't generally make open source programs, but if I don't get anything from keeping it to myself, I'll probably create a repo for it.

Pronouns: who cares about that, you can call me whatever you want.

Characteristics: Horrible Coding Style, can't name variables and functions, always trying to make above average code in efficiency, improving decently fast, can watch tutorials at 4x playback speed (some).

Skills: 70-80 WPM average on my better days, can type in both QWERTY and COLEMAK (colemak ftw), obsessed with programming, good at learning new things.

I'm bad: in making video games, basically anything other than programming, especially bad at art. Also, I don't follow programming conventions in general.

If anyone wants to collab with me in some way or ask me about one of my projects, or whatever, my discord is rob405#2570 (DMs open).
